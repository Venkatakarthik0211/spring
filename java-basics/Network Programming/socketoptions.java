//Socket Options 
/*To rectify the problem of nagle'salgorithm problem of bragging down network sending datagrams, 
 * TCP_NODELAY is used - set and get of TcpNoDelay 
 * 
 * SO_LINGER throws the remaining datagrams once it has set to 0, (During socket closing)
 * if positive, it waits until those to oomplete. 
 * setSoLiinger(true,+ve) and getSoLinger()
 * 
 * SO_TIMEOUT limits the time required to read the bytes without any obstruction. (During socket connection)
 * 0 is infinite time, +ve - limited, -ve illegalArguement
 * setSoTimeout(a)
 * 
 * SO_RCVBUF, setRecieveBufferSize(a), get() suggests number of bytes to use for buffering output on reciving side
 * >0, sets the size, <=0 illegalArguement 
 * 
 * SO_SNDBUF, setSendBufferSizw(a), get() suggests number of bytes used for bufferSize output on sendder side
 * >0, sets the size, <=0 illegalArguement 
 *
 *Without SO_KEEPALIVE, an inactive client could live more or less forever without noticing that the server had crashed.
 *setKeepAlive(boolean on)
 *
 *setOOBInline(boolean on), get() allows to send the urgent data
 *
 * If the SO_REUSEADDR is turned on (itâ€™s turned off by default), 
 * another socket is allowed to bind to the port even while data may be outstanding for the previous socket.
 * setReuseAddress(boolean on)
