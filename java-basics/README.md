## Overview 🌐

This repository serves as a portfolio of my progress in mastering data structures and algorithms. From classic sorting algorithms to advanced data structures like trees and graphs, you'll find a diverse set of implementations here.

## Languages 🚀

- Python 🐍
- Java ☕
- C 🧑‍💻

I believe in learning through practical implementation, so I've implemented each algorithm and data structure in multiple languages to reinforce my understanding.

## Directory Structure 📁

The repository is organized into the following main directories:

- `DSA/`: Code for fundamental data structures revision.
  - `Bit Manipulation/`: Code for fundamental Bit Manipulation Operations
- `DSA_codes/`: Code for fundamental data structures.
  - `Arrays/`: Codes are the implementation of Arrays.
  - `Basics`: Codes are the implementation of Basic Programs such as loops, applications etc.
  - `Linked List`: Codes are the implementation of Linked Lists
  - `Miscellaneous`: Codes are the implementation of wide variety pf algorithms
  - `Stacks and Queues`: Codes are the implementation of Stacks and Queues
  - `Trees`: Codes are the implementation of Trees
 

Feel free to explore and dive into specific directories based on your interest.

## How to Use 🛠️

You can easily navigate to the specific directory of interest and find the code implementation along with comments explaining the logic. Each file is designed to be self-contained, making it easy to understand and run independently.

```bash
# Example: Run a Java implementation of a sorting algorithm
cd DSA_codes/Arrays
javac bubble_sort.java && java bubble_sort.java < output.txt
